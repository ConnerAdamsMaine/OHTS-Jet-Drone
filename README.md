# OHTS-Jet-Drone
## Explanation
Jet Drone is a project started and overseen by Mr David Langevin from the Oxford Hills Technical School.
The goal is to produce a working control unit for the base of a wheelchair with single and dual motor control.
Involved are members of both the Pre-Engineering Year 2 class and Computer Technology Year 2 and Year 3 classes.

Above and below are our links/sources to documentation on code, command, and design. Included are the schematics and all code involved (HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and C++)

## Code Usage
*HTML* - HTML was chosen for the web design used to control the drone, included with HTML was some basic CSS and JavaScript for web use.

*CSS/JS* - Additions of the afformentioned HTML for use only in the basic control website.

*Python* - Python was solely chosen for it's simplicity and usage. It is used in the website for communication to the Raspberry Pi/Arduios and for back-end work. It is also used in a simple UI to control the drone from close range using bluetooth or wifi, not including video.

*C++* - C++ is used for most every major component of this project. The Arduino's controlling the motors, the communication between arduino and raspberry pi, and any other background processes required.

## Required Modules
__Python__ - Tkinter, RPi.GPIO, Serial, time, and Flask.

*Tkinter* - ```pip install tkinter```  
*RPi.GPIO* - ```pip install RPi.GPIO```  
*Serial* - ```pip install PySerial```  
*time* - ```pip install time```  
*Flask* - ```pip install Flask```
